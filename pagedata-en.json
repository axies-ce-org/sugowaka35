      "What is the Copyright Act?",
      "(Japanese) Copyright Act",
      "Article 1 of the Copyright Act states the purpose of the Act.",
      "Article 1 (Purpose)   \nThe purpose of this Act is to provide for authors' rights and neighboring rights with respect to works, as well as\n        with respect to performances, phonograms, broadcasts, and cablecasts, and to ensure protection for the rights of\n        authors and other such persons while according attention to the fair exploitation of these cultural products, and\n        thereby to contribute to cultural development.",
      "Konaka   \nThe Copyright Act protects the rights of those who create copyrighted works.\n      Sumiki   \nThat is correct, but there is another important role. That is the fair exploitation of copyrighted works. In\n        other words, we make it easier for everyone to use copyrighted works by determining the extent to which they can\n        be used freely.\n      Daiin   \nIf you protect the rights too strictly, it will be difficult for people to use copyrighted works, and if you\n        give them too much freedom, your rights will not be protected ...\n      Sumiki   \nIt is difficult to find a balance between the protection of rights and fair exploitation.\n      Konaka   What exactly do you mean by “cultural development”?      Sumiki   \nCultural development as referred to in the Copyright Act essentially means the creation of a wide variety of\n        expressive works. In the field of technology covered by patents, to give an extreme example, it could just be a\n        single technology. For example, if the price is the same, everyone would want to use the battery that lasts the\n        longest. But this is not the case for copyrighted works. Sometimes you would like to listen to Mr. Children\n        songs, sometimes you want to listen to Perfume songs, right?\n      Konaka   \nI see. So, the idea is that by creating a variety of expressions, we can create a richer society. Many people\n        create copyrighted works every day, and because there are no registration procedures required, the system makes\n        it easier for many copyrighted works to be created.",
      "Point      \nThe purpose of the Copyright Act is to contribute to cultural development through the protection of the rights of\n        authors and the fair exploitation of copyrighted works.",
      "",
      "The Copyright Act determines what a copyrighted work is, what kind of rights are copyrightable (protection of\n      authors), and in what cases copyright is limited (what is fair exploitation?).",
      "Konaka   \nHowever, the law is difficult and I don't understand it well ...There are many places where the law is not\n        very specific.\n      Sumiki   \nThe law intentionally stipulates abstractly, and leaves room for interpretation, so some people may have\n        different opinions. Sometimes you don't know until a decision by the court is given.\n      Daiin   \nThis means that sometimes things cannot be clearly defined as black and white right away.\n      Sumiki   \nWe want to keep things black and white if possible. There are many materials that teachers can refer to. One of\n        them is titled the \"Guidelines for Article 35 under the Amended Copyright Act\".＊1",

      "Definition of copyrighted works",
      "Konaka   Copyrighted works are not diminished by their use, are they?      Sumiki   \nThat's right. For example, if a car is stolen, it will be gone, so you will know right away. However, most of\n        the time even if text is stolen, it will not be lost, so in most cases it is not immediately obvious if it is\n        being misused. Among such intangible information, information that contributes to cultural development is\n        copyrighted work.\n      Daiin   But you can tell when a painting on a canvas is stolen, can't you?      Sumiki   \nA painting is indeed a copyrighted work, but it has two aspects: one as a \"tangible object\" and the other as\n        \"information\". You may think of a copyrighted work as a \"tangible object\", but a copyrighted work is\n        \"information\". In other words, the copyrighted work (information) is superimposed on the tangible object\n        (painting)＊1. It would be a problem if someone made and sold postcards or other\n        goods using the painting without permission, wouldn't it?Even if you buy a painting, you are simply\n        receiving the rights to the tangible object, the physical ownership (title). The rights to the information\n        (copyright) of the person who originally painted the painting remain with the person who painted it.\n      Daiin   I see, so it's not the same as physical ownership.",

Sumiki   \nThe idea itself is not a copyrighted work because it has to be expressed.

(1) Fantasy novel setting.(2) A cat drawing on a piece of notepaper, done at the behest of a relative's child.(3) Names of cartoon characters.(4) Graphs in student reports.      (1) Fantasy novel setting      Konaka   \nSince the novel is copyrighted, is the setting copyrighted as well?\n      Sumiki   \nNo, an abstract setting alone does not constitute a copyrighted work. For example, recently, there are novels,\n          manga, and anime in which the main character is transported to and explores another world. This level of\n          setting itself is within the scope of an idea and is not copyrighted, so writing a new novel with this kind of\n          setting is not an infringement of copyright.\n       (2) A cat drawing on a piece of notepaper that a relative's child asked me to draw.      Daiin   \nSomething like a drawing on a piece of notepaper would probably be thrown away immediately so is not a\n          copyrighted work, is it?\n      Sumiki   \nNo, it does not matter under the Copyright Act when you throw it away, it is a copyrighted work because it was\n          a \"creative expression\" at the time it was drawn＊2.\n       (3) Names of cartoon characters      Konaka   This is surely a copyrighted work!      Sumiki   \nNice try. This is not a copyrighted work. Konaka's name is not a copyrighted work either. There are various\n          opinions on it, but I think it can be categorized as not being \"within the literary, academic, artistic, or\n          musical domain\" or not having creativity. However, a picture of a character is a copyrighted work＊3.\n       (4) Graphs in student reports      Daiin   \nI don't think a graph is a copyrighted work. Mere data isn't a copyrighted work, and if it were just a graph\n          of data, it wouldn't be creative.\n      Sumiki   \nIf the graph looks the same no matter who draws it in Excel or other software, it is not creative and is not\n          likely to be a copyrighted work. However, if the graph shows, for example, beer consumption, and uses a\n          creative way to express it, such as by using a picture of a beer mug instead of a bar graph, the creativity of\n          the graph may be recognized and the work may be copyrighted work.",
      "Memo ＊2      \nThe word \"expression\" may sound like it has to be fixed on some object, but being fixed is not a requirement\n        for a copyrighted work. For cinematographic works, it is a requirement that the copyrighted work be fixed.",

If the number of people using a work changes from time to time, it is \"unspecified\" and can\n        still constitute \"the public\".For example, it is expected that the Forum will set a strict limit on the\n        number of students in a seminar and that certain criteria such as less than 10 students will be set forth to\n        exclude it from being considered a \"public\".",
      "Public communication (p. 9 of the Guidelines)",
      "A \"public transmission,\" such as a broadcast or Internet distribution, is intended to be directly received by the\n      public. A public transmission is when a work that has been publicly transmitted is further shown or heard by the\n      public using a receiver.",
      "Applicable Examples  \nReceiving videos on the Internet related to class content during a class, and having students and pupils watch\n          them on displays, etc. installed in the classroom.\n \nWebsites related to class content are projected on a screen using a projector in the classroom for students\n          and pupils to see.",
      "\"Educational Institutions\" to which Article 35 applies (p. 6 of the Guidelines).",
      "A non-profit educational institution that engages in educational activities on an organized and continuous basis,\n      and is established under the applicable laws and regulations, is an educational institution to which Article 35\n      applies.",
      "Applicable Examples  \nKindergartens, elementary schools, junior high schools, compulsory education schools, high schools, secondary\n          education schools, special support schools, technical colleges, various schools, special training schools,\n          universities, etc. (School Education Law).\n \nEducational institutions similar to universities such as the National Defense Academy, National Tax College,\n          and local government agricultural colleges (laws and ordinances related to the establishment of each ministry,\n          organizational ordinances, etc.).\n \nEducational institutions related to vocational training, etc. (e.g., Human Resources Development Promotion\n          Act).\n \nDaycare centers, certified child daycare centers, and school-age childcare centers (Child Welfare Law, Law\n          Concerning the Promotion of Comprehensive Provision of Education and Care for Pre-school Children).\n \nCommunity centers, museums, art galleries, libraries, youth centers, lifelong learning centers, and other\n          similar social education facilities (Social Education Law, Museum Law, Library Law, etc.).\n \nEducation Centers, Teacher Training Centers (Act on Organization and Administration of Local Educational\n          Administration, etc.).\n \nSchools managed by a company establishing schools (Act on Special Zones for Structural Reform.

Training facilities run by companies, organizations, etc.",
      "\"Classes\" to which Article 35 applies (p. 7 of the Guidelines)",
      "The \"classes\" here are not classes in the general sense, but only \"classes\" to which Article 35 can apply. The\n      Guidelines define it as \"educational activities conducted by a person in charge of education under the\n      responsibility of a school or other educational institution and its control, for learners. It does not include\n      activities conducted by students on their own initiative or by teachers teaching each other.",

      "Daiin   \nAre primary and secondary club activities \"classes\" and college club activities not \"classes\"?\n      Sumiki   \nClub activities in elementary schools are defined as educational activities called \"special activities\" in the\n        Courses of Study. Club activities in junior high and high schools are voluntary activities of students, but they\n        are equivalent to special activities, such as those conducted under the guidance of the teacher in charge. On the other hand, this is not the case for universities, which means that they do not fall under the\n        definition of \"classes. \"",
      "\"Person in charge of teaching\" and \"person taking classes\" (p. 8 of the Guidelines)",
      "Next, we will explain the \"person in charge of teaching\" and the \"person taking classes\" in Article 35. These are\n      defined as follows.",
      "Person in charge of teaching = the person who teaches the class  \nTeachers, professors, lecturers, etc., regardless of name, having teaching licenses, or employment status such\n          as full-time or part-time.\n \nWhen educational supporters and assistants such as administrative staff and Teaching Assistants (TAs), under\n          the direction of teachers and instructors, reproduce or publicly transmit the materials by using school\n          facilities or other means under the control of the school, it is an act of the teachers and instructors.",
      "Persons taking classes = persons who learn under the guidance of a teacher or other instructor  Children, students, pupils, non-degree students, pupils, etc., regardless of name or age. \nIf, at the request of a student or pupil, an educational supporter or assistant, such as an administrative\n          staff member or TA, duplicates or publicly transmits the work in a manner that is within the control of the\n          school, such as by using school facilities, the act is an act of the student or pupil.",
      "The extent that is found to be necessary (p. 8 of the Guidelines)",
      "The faculty member in charge of the class will determine whether the reproduction is \"the extent that is found to\n      be necessary\" for the classes. The teacher must be able to objectively explain why reproduction, public\n      transmission, or public communication is necessary.",
      "No standard can always be used to determine whether a book is within \"the extent that is found to be necessary,\"\n      for example, how many pages it can be. It depends on the content of the class and the way it is conducted and\n      should be determined according to the actual conditions of each class.",
      "When the extent is found to be necessary:  Public transmission to within one class. Any number of class members. \nDistributing copies of class materials to parents visiting classes and teachers participating in research\n          classes＊6.\n    Memo ＊6     P. 12 of the Guidelines.",
      "When the extent is found not to be necessary:  Public transmission in a form that can be accessed by anyone. \nDistributing video files to the entire class when the instructor only needs to project a TV program related to\n          the class content on a screen.\n Use of teaching materials with other faculty members. \nCopying the entire book and transmitting it publicly to students, even though only a portion of the book is\n          used in class.",
      "Point     Understand the definitions in the Guidelines to determine if Article 35 can apply.",
      "Cases in which the interests of the copyright owner would be unreasonably prejudiced (pp. 9-19 of the Guidelines)",
      "The end of Article 35(1) says, however, this shall not apply\" if the action would unreasonably prejudice the\n      interests of the copyright owner in light of the nature and purpose of the work, the number of copies that would\n      be made, and the circumstances of its reproduction, public transmission, or communication\". This proviso should be\n      taken into consideration.",
      "Konaka   \nWhen does \"unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner\" take place?\n      Sumiki   \nJust by reading the article, it's not clear to what extent it would be unduly harmful.P. 11 of the\n        Guidelines states that an important aspect is \"whether or not the reproduction or public transmission will\n        decrease the sales of commercial products or hinder the potential future sales channels of copyrighted works\".For example, if all the math drills used by elementary school students were copied and distributed to\n        everyone in the class, there would be no need to buy the drills. This kind of action unreasonably prejudices the\n        interests of the copyright owner.However, it is difficult to determine, as it depends on the situation and\n        the state of use. This area is also discussed in the Forum and will be explained.",
      "The term \"unreasonably prejudice the interests\" as used in the proviso means \"unreasonably reducing\" sales. Even\n      if the use is to \"the extent that is found to be necessary\", if the copyright owner can objectively explain that\n      the use \"unreasonably prejudices the interests of the copyright owner,\" such use is unauthorized and not allowed.",
      "If works are reproduced or publicly transmitted without permission for teaching, it will have some impact on the\n      sales of commercial products. This is why the system of paying compensation was established. Therefore, it is\n      thought that a little use can be covered by compensation. The wording to \"unreasonably prejudice the interests of\n      a copyright owner\" is indicative of a considerable amount of usage.",
      "The Guidelines provide the concept and examples of what constitutes to \"unreasonably prejudice the interests of\n      the copyright owner\".",
      "Types of works",
      "Reproduction and public transmission of copyrighted works, such as drills and software, which should be purchased\n      separately by each student/pupil, unfairly diminish sales and unreasonably prejudice the interests of the\n      copyright owners.",
      "In the case of short verbal works (haiku, tanka, poetry, etc.), pictorial and photographic works, the use of the\n      entire work is essential, and partial use may constitute an infringement of the integrity right. For such types of\n      works, reproduction or public transmission of the entirety of a work is unlikely to unreasonably prejudice the\n      interests of the copyright owner, etc.",
      "On the other hand, the reproduction and public transmission of an entire feature film or novel are likely to cause\n      unreasonable prejudice to the interests of the copyright owner. If a work is quite difficult to obtain, and\n      permission for its use cannot be obtained through reasonable means, it may be possible to reproduce the entire\n      work, and it is considered necessary to make a judgment on a case-by-case basis.",
      "When reading a thesis in a college class or seminar, you will generally read the entire report. On the other hand,\n      because the articles are specialized, their target readers are limited, so when reproducing or publicly\n      transmitting them in class, it is necessary to carefully consider whether the interests of the copyright owner\n      will be unreasonably prejudiced (Chapter 3, Q14, Q15)＊7.",
      "Memo ＊7      \nIf the article you need is available for free in a university-contracted e-journal, author's website, or\n        institutional repository, provide the link to the student. Providing the link does not constitute reproduction\n        or public transmission, so it is not a problem.",
      "Uses of Copyrighted Works",
      "In the case of works sold to students and pupils, the application of Article 35's limitation of rights may have a\n      direct impact on sales. Therefore, the possibility of unreasonably prejudicing the interests of copyright owners\n      is likely to be higher than in the case of other uses of copyrighted works.",
      "If the work is designed as a textbook for students and pupils, it is unlikely that the reproduction of a large\n      portion of the work will unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner if it is in the designated\n      textbook and everyone has it.",
      "Number of copies and number of recipients of public transmission",
      "P. 18 of the Guidelines states that reproduction and public transmission up to the number of students in the class\n      in question, regardless of the number of students, will not unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright\n      owner.",
      "In addition, when the same materials are sent to students for parent visits or faculty visits in research classes,\n      the number of students plus the number of visitors is \"the extent that is found to be necessary\". In this case,\n      this would not unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner.",
      "Showing a recording of a movie or TV program in the classroom can be done without permission as a non-profit,\n      free-of-charge showing (Article 38(1)). However, making a copy of the movie and distributing it to a certain\n      number of students or making it available for viewing on demand at any time is likely to unreasonably prejudice\n      the interests of the copyright owner＊8.",
      "Memo ＊8      \nAs for making available for later viewing not the video file itself but a recording of the class scene in which\n        it is being viewed, there is no substitute for viewing the video file, so it is unlikely to unreasonably\n        prejudice the copyright owner's interests.",
      "Manner of reproduction, public transmission, and public communication",
      "The term \"manner\" is unfamiliar, but it means so much more than the manner of reproduction or public transmission.",
      "Making copies of a work in a form that allows the work to be bound and preserved for a long period, or making\n      copies of images or sounds as files of such high quality that they can be viewed independently, or in any other\n      way that allows the copies to be used for other purposes on their own, is likely to unreasonably prejudice the\n      copyright owner's interests.",
      "In the case of public transmissions, those who can receive the information should be limited to those who teach\n      the class and those who receive the information. For example, even if the transmission of information to the world\n      by students is a necessary activity for classes, the inclusion of copyrighted works covered by Article 35 in such\n      activities is likely to unreasonably prejudice the interests of copyright owners＊9.",
      "Memo ＊9      Of course, if the \"citation\" in Article 32 can apply, there is no problem.",
      "The basic concept is above. Examples are summarized below.",
      "Examples where reproducing the whole thing is unlikely to unreasonably prejudice the interests of copyright\n        owners.\n  \nUse of copyrighted works in adopted textbooks.\n \nIncludes individual works (written works, photographs, illustrations, etc.) as well as works by the\n              publishers who published them.\n \nDigital textbooks for learners used as a replacement for adopted textbooks are also allowed for use within\n              the contract.\n   \nIf it is difficult to use only a part of the material, or if the right of identity preservation would be\n          infringed by cutting out a part of the material.\n Haiku, tanka, poetry, and other short works of language. Articles and other verbal works published in newspapers. Photographs, paintings (including illustrations, prints, etc.). Sculptures and other three-dimensional works of art.   \nArticles in magazines and other publications that have been out of circulation for a considerable period and\n          are no longer readily available.\n \nReproduction of a portion of the material (all figures and graphs, etc.) that the student/pupil has purchased\n          and projected on a screen for display.\n Copyrighted works used as part of images in videos of classroom scenes and commentary.",
      "Examples that are likely to unreasonably prejudice the interests of copyright owners.  \nHanding out copies of all the books in one class, such as \"Chapter 1 in the first class, Chapter 2 in the\n          second class ...\".\n \nProviding copyrighted works that students would normally purchase and use in a form that does not require them\n          to purchase them.\n \nDrills, reference books, test books, music scores for teaching materials, supplementary reading books,\n              educational video software, scripts for plays, music scores for club activities, etc.\n   \nPurchasing only one program or one license of a program or application, and duplicating and distributing it to\n          multiple students or pupils.\n Collecting art, photographs, etc., and distributing high quality, bound copies. \nSystematically storing copyrighted works as materials on servers, creating databases and libraries, without\n          knowing whether or not they will be handled in class.\n Although not directly covered in class, copies should be distributed as reference materials.",
      "Point     Do not unreasonably prejudice the interests of copyright owners!",
      "Konaka   \nIn short, Article 35 stipulates that \"published works\" may be used by teachers and students \"in the course of classes\" at the appropriate\n\"educational institution\" to the \"the extent that is deemed to be necessary\" for the classes. As long as the amount and usage do not unreasonably prejudice the interests of copyright owners,\nyou don't have to get permission from the copyright owner＊10.\n      Daiin   \nTeachers and students can reproduce, publicly communicate and pay compensation for public transmissions.\n      Sumiki   \nIn addition, when they use copyrighted work under Article 35(1), the source of the copyrighted work must be\n\tindicated if a common practice exists (Article 48(1)(iii)). Whether or not there is a common practice depends\n\ton the type of copyrighted work and the method of use＊11.",
      "Memo ＊10     Article 35 can also apply to neighboring rights (Article 102(1)). Thus, you can use copyrighted works that have been performed, recorded, broadcast,or broadcast by cable.",
      "Memo ＊11     In educational situations, the source of the information must be indicated to measure its reliability. Therefore, for example, it is a common practice for users to indicate the source of the information when they reproduce diagrams and tables of others in slide materials.",

Sumiki   \nAs long as the class is held in a classroom, Article 35 can apply and it is fine.

Sumiki   \nYou need to clearly state the source when using citations, too. These days, you are likely to disseminate your\n        educational activities outside of the university, so please be sure to record the source in case that happens.Also, if you reproduce a work from a website, please be careful to ensure that it is not a secondhand citation\n        of the work.\n      Daiin   Secondhand citation?

Also, since everyone is\n          working together to create one teaching material, it is likely to be a joint work, but of course, it will be\n          agreed that each teacher will use it in their class, so there is no problem in reproducing it in each class or\n          making a public transmission in an online class＊1.",

The materials should be removed after the period or their settings should be\n          changed so that students cannot access them.It is difficult to determine when the class period begins\n          and ends, but in the case of universities, it seems safe to assume that the class period lasts until the\n          evaluation of grades and credits is completed.In addition, in classes that are supposed to be\n          taken in stages, such as \"Exercise 1\" and \"Exercise 2\", it would fall within \"in the course of class\" to allow\n          students to view the material from Exercise 1 during the class period of Exercise 2 as well＊11.This is because the Guidelines state that preparation and review are also \"in the course of classes\",\n          and if there is a content relationship between Exercise 1 and Exercise 2, then the materials for Exercise 1\n          are equivalent to those for review.In addition, as explained at the end of \"Chapter 2, Section 04:\n          Guidelines for Article 35 of the Amended Copyright Act\", the possibility of continued use of educational\n          materials outside the period of a class is under consideration to be covered by the SARTRAS License＊.",
