As explained in Chapter 1, the Guidelines explain terminology based on specific scenarios when dealing with
      copyrighted works in the classroom.
</p> <h4 id="ref36">Reproduction (p. 5 of the Guidelines)</h4> <p>
So-called photocopying, but making a PDF of a paper or taking a photograph of a paper document is also a
      "reproduction". The following examples fall under the category of reproduction.

Transmission to "an unspecified person or a large number of specified persons (the public)" by broadcasting, cable
      broadcasting, Internet transmission, or other means, including making available for transmission through the
      Internet by storing on a web server (making transmittable). Transmission between a teacher and students in a class
      is a public transmission.
</p> <div class="list-area grid gap-3 border-y border-orange-500 py-4 md:gap-6 md:py-6">  <p>Applicable Examples</p> <ul> <li>

P. 6 of the Guidelines says, "In general, transmission between a teacher and students in a class is considered
        to be a public transmission", so we should assume that Dr. Konaka's class is also public.<br>It is not clearly
        defined how many people are specifically referred to as "the public" in the Copyright Act.<br><br>According
        to the Guidelines, at least the standard number of people in an elementary school class would make it "public,"
        but there is no specific standard for how many people fit the definition of "public". It is difficult to handle
        such a legally gray area, but it seems that the Forum has not yet reached a common agreement on the number of
        people.

It is important to note that if the number of people is unidentifiable (unspecified), they are interpreted as
        "the public" even if the number of people is small. This is an area of disagreement even among the experts.

Just because the number of people using a copyrighted work is small does not mean that it is not representative
        of "the public". If the number of people using a work changes from time to time, it is "unspecified" and can
        still constitute "the public".<br>For example, it is expected that the Forum will set a strict limit on the
        number of students in a seminar and that certain criteria such as less than 10 students will be set forth to
        exclude it from being considered a "public".
</p> </div> </div>  </div> <h4 id="ref6">Public communication (p. 9 of the Guidelines)</h4> <p>
A "public transmission," such as a broadcast or Internet distribution, is intended to be directly received by the
      public. A public transmission is when a work that has been publicly transmitted is further shown or heard by the
      public using a receiver.
</p> <div class="list-area grid gap-3 border-y border-orange-500 py-4 md:gap-6 md:py-6">  <p>Applicable Examples</p> <ul> <li>
Receiving videos on the Internet related to class content during a class, and having students and pupils watch
          them on displays, etc. installed in the classroom.
</li> <li>
Websites related to class content are projected on a screen using a projector in the classroom for students
          and pupils to see.
</li> </ul>  </div> <h4>"Educational Institutions" to which Article 35 applies (p. 6 of the Guidelines).</h4> <p>
A non-profit educational institution that engages in educational activities on an organized and continuous basis,
      and is established under the applicable laws and regulations, is an educational institution to which Article 35
      applies.

The "classes" here are not classes in the general sense, but only "classes" to which Article 35 can apply. The
      Guidelines define it as "educational activities conducted by a person in charge of education under the
      responsibility of a school or other educational institution and its control, for learners. It does not include

Club activities in elementary schools are defined as educational activities called "special activities" in the
        Courses of Study. Club activities in junior high and high schools are voluntary activities of students, but they
        are equivalent to special activities, such as those conducted under the guidance of the teacher in charge. <br>On the other hand, this is not the case for universities, which means that they do not fall under the
        definition of "classes. "
</p> </div> </div>  </div> <h4>"Person in charge of teaching" and "person taking classes" (p. 8 of the Guidelines)</h4> <p>
Next, we will explain the "person in charge of teaching" and the "person taking classes" in Article 35. These are
      defined as follows.
</p> <div class="list-area grid gap-3 border-y border-orange-500 py-4 md:gap-6 md:py-6">  <p>Person in charge of teaching = the person who teaches the class</p> <ul> <li>

          as full-time or part-time.
</li> <li>
When educational supporters and assistants such as administrative staff and Teaching Assistants (TAs), under
          the direction of teachers and instructors, reproduce or publicly transmit the materials by using school
          facilities or other means under the control of the school, it is an act of the teachers and instructors.
</li> </ul>  </div> <div class="list-area grid gap-3 border-y border-orange-500 py-4 md:gap-6 md:py-6">  <p>Persons taking classes = persons who learn under the guidance of a teacher or other instructor</p> <ul> <li>Children, students, pupils, non-degree students, pupils, etc., regardless of name or age.</li> <li>
If, at the request of a student or pupil, an educational supporter or assistant, such as an administrative
          staff member or TA, duplicates or publicly transmits the work in a manner that is within the control of the
          school, such as by using school facilities, the act is an act of the student or pupil.
</li> </ul>  </div> <h4>The extent that is found to be necessary (p. 8 of the Guidelines)</h4> <p>
The faculty member in charge of the class will determine whether the reproduction is "the extent that is found to
      be necessary" for the classes. The teacher must be able to objectively explain why reproduction, public
      transmission, or public communication is necessary.
</p> <p>
No standard can always be used to determine whether a book is within "the extent that is found to be necessary,"
      for example, how many pages it can be. It depends on the content of the class and the way it is conducted and
      should be determined according to the actual conditions of each class.

Cases in which the interests of the copyright owner would be unreasonably prejudiced (pp. 9-19 of the Guidelines)
</h4> <p>
The end of Article 35(1) says, however, this shall not apply" if the action would unreasonably prejudice the
      interests of the copyright owner in light of the nature and purpose of the work, the number of copies that would
      be made, and the circumstances of its reproduction, public transmission, or communication". This proviso should be
      taken into consideration.

Just by reading the article, it's not clear to what extent it would be unduly harmful.<br>P. 11 of the
        Guidelines states that an important aspect is "whether or not the reproduction or public transmission will
        decrease the sales of commercial products or hinder the potential future sales channels of copyrighted works".<br><br>For example, if all the math drills used by elementary school students were copied and distributed to
        everyone in the class, there would be no need to buy the drills. This kind of action unreasonably prejudices the
        interests of the copyright owner.<br>However, it is difficult to determine, as it depends on the situation and
        the state of use. This area is also discussed in the Forum and will be explained.
</p> </div> </div>  </div> <p>
The term "unreasonably prejudice the interests" as used in the proviso means "unreasonably reducing" sales. Even
      if the use is to "the extent that is found to be necessary", if the copyright owner can objectively explain that
      the use "unreasonably prejudices the interests of the copyright owner," such use is unauthorized and not allowed.
</p> <p>
If works are reproduced or publicly transmitted without permission for teaching, it will have some impact on the
      sales of commercial products. This is why the system of paying compensation was established. Therefore, it is
      thought that a little use can be covered by compensation. The wording to "unreasonably prejudice the interests of
      a copyright owner" is indicative of a considerable amount of usage.
</p> <p>
The Guidelines provide the concept and examples of what constitutes to "unreasonably prejudice the interests of
      the copyright owner".
</p> <h4 id="ref31">Types of works</h4> <p>
Reproduction and public transmission of copyrighted works, such as drills and software, which should be purchased
      separately by each student/pupil, unfairly diminish sales and unreasonably prejudice the interests of the
      copyright owners.
</p> <p>
In the case of short verbal works (haiku, tanka, poetry, etc.), pictorial and photographic works, the use of the
      entire work is essential, and partial use may constitute an infringement of the integrity right. For such types of
      works, reproduction or public transmission of the entirety of a work is unlikely to unreasonably prejudice the
      interests of the copyright owner, etc.
</p> <p>
On the other hand, the reproduction and public transmission of an entire feature film or novel are likely to cause
      unreasonable prejudice to the interests of the copyright owner. If a work is quite difficult to obtain, and
      permission for its use cannot be obtained through reasonable means, it may be possible to reproduce the entire
      work, and it is considered necessary to make a judgment on a case-by-case basis.
</p> <p>
When reading a thesis in a college class or seminar, you will generally read the entire report. On the other hand,
      because the articles are specialized, their target readers are limited, so when reproducing or publicly
      transmitting them in class, it is necessary to carefully consider whether the interests of the copyright owner
      will be unreasonably prejudiced (Chapter 3, Q14, Q15)<sup class="whitespace-nowrap font-medium text-gray-500">＊7</sup>.
</p> <div id="c2s4_9" class="point"> <p class="ml-3 inline-block rounded-t-lg bg-orange-600 px-4 py-0.5 text-sm/normal font-medium uppercase text-white md:ml-4 md:px-4 md:py-1 md:text-base"> Memo ＊7 </p> <div class="rounded-2xl bg-stone-100 p-3 md:p-4">    <p>
If the article you need is available for free in a university-contracted e-journal, author's website, or
        institutional repository, provide the link to the student. Providing the link does not constitute reproduction
        or public transmission, so it is not a problem.
</p>  </div> </div> <h4>Uses of Copyrighted Works</h4> <p>
In the case of works sold to students and pupils, the application of Article 35's limitation of rights may have a
      direct impact on sales. Therefore, the possibility of unreasonably prejudicing the interests of copyright owners
      is likely to be higher than in the case of other uses of copyrighted works.
</p> <p>
If the work is designed as a textbook for students and pupils, it is unlikely that the reproduction of a large
      portion of the work will unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner if it is in the designated
      textbook and everyone has it.
</p> <h4>Number of copies and number of recipients of public transmission</h4> <p>
P. 18 of the Guidelines states that reproduction and public transmission up to the number of students in the class
      in question, regardless of the number of students, will not unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright
      owner.
</p> <p>
In addition, when the same materials are sent to students for parent visits or faculty visits in research classes,
      the number of students plus the number of visitors is "the extent that is found to be necessary". In this case,
      this would not unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner.
</p> <p>
Showing a recording of a movie or TV program in the classroom can be done without permission as a non-profit,
      free-of-charge showing (Article 38(1)). However, making a copy of the movie and distributing it to a certain
      number of students or making it available for viewing on demand at any time is likely to unreasonably prejudice
      the interests of the copyright owner<sup class="whitespace-nowrap font-medium text-gray-500">＊8</sup>.
</p> <div id="c2s4_10" class="point"> <p class="ml-3 inline-block rounded-t-lg bg-orange-600 px-4 py-0.5 text-sm/normal font-medium uppercase text-white md:ml-4 md:px-4 md:py-1 md:text-base"> Memo ＊8 </p> <div class="rounded-2xl bg-stone-100 p-3 md:p-4">    <p>
As for making available for later viewing not the video file itself but a recording of the class scene in which
        it is being viewed, there is no substitute for viewing the video file, so it is unlikely to unreasonably
        prejudice the copyright owner's interests.
</p>  </div> </div> <h4 id="ref7">Manner of reproduction, public transmission, and public communication</h4> <p>
The term "manner" is unfamiliar, but it means so much more than the manner of reproduction or public transmission.
</p> <p>
Making copies of a work in a form that allows the work to be bound and preserved for a long period, or making
      copies of images or sounds as files of such high quality that they can be viewed independently, or in any other
      way that allows the copies to be used for other purposes on their own, is likely to unreasonably prejudice the
      copyright owner's interests.
</p> <p>
In the case of public transmissions, those who can receive the information should be limited to those who teach
      the class and those who receive the information. For example, even if the transmission of information to the world
      by students is a necessary activity for classes, the inclusion of copyrighted works covered by Article 35 in such
      activities is likely to unreasonably prejudice the interests of copyright owners<sup class="whitespace-nowrap font-medium text-gray-500">＊9</sup>.
