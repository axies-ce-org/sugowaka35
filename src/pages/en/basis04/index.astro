    <h3>Copyright is "the right not to do specific acts without permission”</h3>
    <SpeechBubbles>
      <Bubble speaker="Sumiki" feLevel="2">
        In simple terms, copyright is the right not to have one's copyrighted work "do specific acts without
        permission".
      </Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Konaka" feLevel="3">
        Such as, it can't be copied without permission, or remade without permission.
      </Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Sumiki" feLevel="2">
        Japan has a 'non-formality' system, which means that a copyright is automatically granted the moment a work is
        created. Simply put, there is no need to register or go through any other procedures to obtain a copyright.
      </Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Konaka" feLevel="3">Even pictures drawn by elementary school children?</Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Daiin" feLevel="2">And reports written by students?</Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Sumiki" feLevel="1">Yes.</Bubble>
    </SpeechBubbles>
    <Point>When a copyrighted work is created, a copyright is automatically granted (Article 17(2)).</Point>
    <p>
      In a broad sense, there are two types of copyrights: "moral rights," which protect the author's commitment to the
      copyrighted work, and "copyright (economic rights)", which protect the economic value. The following is an
      explanation of what rights are associated with each.
    </p>

    <h3 id="ref28">Moral rights</h3>
    <p>
      Moral rights cannot be assigned to others and cannot be inherited (Article 59, proviso of Civil Code Article 896).
      Therefore, even if a copyright is assigned, the moral rights remain with the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moral rights cease to exist when the author dies. However, the Copyright Act states that even after the author's
      death, a person who provides or presents a copyrighted work to the public must not commit any act that infringes
      the moral rights of the author (Article 60).
    </p>
    <p>Let us explain what moral rights are.</p>

    <h4 id="ref16">Publication Right (Article 18)</h4>
    <p>
      The publication right is, as the name implies, the right to decide how the author of an unpublished copyrighted
      work will make it public. The author of a derivative work may not publish the derivative work without the consent
      of the author of the original work.
    </p>
    <ListArea>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether to make it public or not.</li>
        <li>When will it be made public?</li>
        <li>
          In what form of publication (publication as a book, broadcast, screening, exhibition, public transmission,
          etc.)?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ListArea>
    <SpeechBubbles>
      <Bubble speaker="Konaka" feLevel="2">
        Do I need the student's consent to submit their painting to a city competition?
      </Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Sumiki" feLevel="2">
        Of course, you must obtain the student's consent. If the student only submitted the painting to the teacher as
        homework, it does not meet the definition of "published".<br />Since you are publishing it to third parties, you
        need the author's consent.<br />There is also the issue of exhibition rights, as such art competitions usually
        involve exhibiting the paintings somewhere.
      </Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Konaka" feLevel="4">I see, I will be careful.</Bubble>
    </SpeechBubbles>

    <h4 id="ref19">Attribution Right (Article 19)</h4>
    <p>
      The attribution right, as the name implies, is the right to determine the name to be displayed as the author when
      the copyrighted work is offered or presented to the public.
    </p>
    <ListArea>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether to display a name or not.</li>
        <li>If displayed, whether it is your real name or an alias (pen name, artist's name, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
    </ListArea>
    <p>
      In the case of derivative works, both the author of the original work (the second sentence of Article 19(1)) and
      the author of the derivative work have the attribution right. There are certain limitations on the attribution
      right and the following cases do not constitute infringement:
    </p>
    <ListArea>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When using a copyrighted work, the user may indicate the name already indicated in the copyrighted work. If
          the author's special intention requires a different name to be indicated, the user must follow the intention
          (Article 19(2)).
        </li>
        <li>
          If it is difficult to indicate the name and there is no risk of harm to the interest of the author in claiming
          to be the author, the name need not be indicated as long as it does not violate fair practice (Article 19(3)).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ListArea>
    <p>
      For example, when background music is played in a hotel lobby, there is no need to announce who the composer is,
      every single time.
    </p>

    <h4 id="ref33">Integrity Right (Article 20)</h4>
    <SpeechBubbles>
      <Bubble speaker="Sumiki" feLevel="2">
        The integrity right is the right not to have the content or the title of the author's copyrighted work "altered
        (modified, mutilated, etc.)" against the author's intention without permission.
      </Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Konaka" feLevel="2">

      </Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Sumiki" feLevel="2">
        Yes. Please note that changing "," to ";" deleting a line break, and changing paragraph breaks or changing the
        wording for consistency may also infringe the integrity right<ModalTrigger id="s4_2" isEN />.
      </Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Daiin" feLevel="5">
        Well, if something like that is wrong, it should be fixed. It's common for student theses to have
        inconsistencies in terminology.
      </Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Sumiki" feLevel="2">
        It is only with the author's consent that you can correct such inconsistencies. In other words, if the author
        corrects the inconsistencies, they may be more careful about it in the future. Then there is no infringement.
      </Bubble>
      <Bubble speaker="Daiin" feLevel="4">That's right.</Bubble>

    <p>However, alterations are permitted in the following cases (Article 20(2)):</p>
    <ListArea>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the use of a work is permitted by application of the following provisions: publication in textbooks
          (Article 33(1) and (4)), publication in substitute materials for textbooks (Article 33-2(1)), reproduction for
          the preparation of expanded textbooks (Article 33-3(1)), and broadcasting of school educational programs
          (Article 34(1)), the use of a work is unavoidable for school education (Article 33-2(1)).
        </li>
        <li>Alteration due to extension, reconstruction, repair, or redecoration of buildings.</li>
        <li>Program version upgrades and other modifications.</li>
        <li>
          Other modifications that are deemed unavoidable in light of the nature of the work and the purpose and manner
          of its use.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ListArea>
    <p>
      An example of (1) is converting difficult Kanji into Hiragana so that they are easier to read for younger
      students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding (4), due to the performance of the printing press, it may not be possible to reproduce the exact colors
      in the same way as the original, or when a singer may not be able to sing the original melody as it was sung
      because of the abilities of the singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to determine the specific extent to which a work is "unavoidable. " If you are not sure, you
      should check with the author.

        />For (2), "the right to communicate to the public," the number of rights has increased as the means of
        communicating publicly have become more diverse due to technological advances.<br />We can communicate to the
        people in front of us via "stage performances," "musical performances," "recitations," and "exhibitions." As
        technology advances and copyrighted works can be fixed in some form, they can be conveyed to people far away.
        These include "transfer," "rent out," and "distribution." Furthermore, "public transmission" and "making
        transmittable" are used to convey copyrighted works to people far away, even if they are not in a tangible form.

      The terms "public transmission right" and "right to make transmittable" may also be unfamiliar to you. The public
      transmission right is the right to transmit a copyrighted work to the public (to an unspecified or specified
      number of persons). For example, among public transmissions, automatic public transmission means putting the
      copyrighted work on a website for a large number of people to view, or posting the copyrighted work on a social
      networking service for a large number of people to see. Making transmittable means uploading a copyrighted work to
      a server, etc. to make it available for automatic public transmission, regardless of whether it has been

        There is a caveat to Dr. Konaka's grandfather's story. <br />The end of the protection term is counted from
        January 1 of the year following the year of the author's death, not from the date of the author's death (Article
        57). Therefore, if the grandfather died on May 1, 2012, the protection term is counted from January 1, 2013,
        which means that the protection term will expire 70 years later, on December 31, 2082.
      </p>
    </Modal>
    <Point>
      The protection term is basically from the time of the creation of the copyrighted work to 70 years after the
      author's death.
    </Point>

    <h3 id="ref26">Public Domain</h3>
    <p>
      Public domain means public ownership. It can be freely used by anyone without the permission of the copyright
      owner<ModalTrigger id="s4_15" isEN />. The following fall under this category.
    </p>
    <Modal id="s4_15" isEN>
      <p>
        To be precise, once in the public domain, anyone is free to perform acts that were the subject of copyright as
        long as they do not infringe on the moral interests of the author (Supreme Court, January 20, 1984, HANREI JIHO
        No. 1107, p. 127 [Ganshinkei Case]).
      </p>
      <p>
        The protection term for moral rights after death is not limited and theoretically lasts forever. Therefore,
        copyrighted works that have entered the public domain 70 years after the author's death are also theoretically
        protected.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, claims regarding moral rights after the author's death can only be made by the deceased author's
        "spouse, children, parents, grandchildren, grandparents, or siblings", in other words, up to the second degree
        of kinship (Article 116(1)). Therefore, if these persons die, there will be no claimant, meaning the end of the
        protection term for moral rights after the author's death.

    <p>
      One of the most famous licenses is the Creative Commons License, but because the name is long, it is sometimes
      abbreviated to "CC". CC is used around the world as a tool for authors who publish their works to express their
      willingness to say, "You are free to use my work as long as you abide by these terms of use".

    <p>
      Please note that sometimes there are people who mistakenly think that because it has CC indicated, they are free
      to use it, but credit is required even for BY.

      In CC, BY must be added. Other conditions can be combined with the indications as shown in the [Creative Commons

    <h3 id="ref12">Limitation of rights</h3>
    <p>
      As explained in Section 01 "What is the Copyright Act?", the Copyright Act aims to develop culture by considering
      not only the protection of authors' rights but also the "fair exploitation" of copyrighted works.
    </p>
    <p>
      To promote "fair exploitation", the Copyright Act stipulates situations in which copyrighted works may be used
      without the permission of the copyright owner, and these are called "limitations of rights"<ModalTrigger
        id="c4_21"
        isEN
      />. These provisions limit the rights of copyright owners and define the scope of fair exploitation.
    </p>
    <Modal id="c4_21" isEN>
      <p>
        Note that the limitation of rights shall not be construed as affecting moral rights (Article 50), so
        consideration must be given to moral rights.
      </p>
    </Modal>
    <p>
      There are many limitations of rights, but the following are a few that may be relevant to you, the reader of this

      We have explained various rules that you should comply with, but if you break those rules and the criminal court
      determines that you have willfully infringed copyright, the criminal penalty is imprisonment for not more than 10
      years or a fine of not more than 10 million yen, or both (Article 119(1)).

        But copyright is a crime requiring a complaint from the victim for prosecution, right?<br />You can't be guilty
        of a crime if no one submits a complaint, right?

        The reason why the Copyright Act has this system is that there is no need to prosecute if the author or
        copyright owner thinks it's okay.<br />However, just because you are not prosecuted does not mean you can do it.
        It is still a violation of the law. As long as you are breaking the law, you never know when you might be
        prosecuted.

      The Copyright Act was amended in 2018 to make it an offense prosecutable without a complaint from a victim if it
      meets all of the following requirements (Article 123(2)):
    </p>
    <ListArea>
      <ul>
        <li>The purpose of obtaining compensation or the purpose of harming the interests of the right owner.</li>
        <li>
          Transferring, publicly transmitting, or reproducing for such purposes, in its original form, a copyrighted
          work that is offered or presented to the public for a fee (paid copyrighted work, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          Unjust harm is caused to the interests of right owners who are expected to gain from the provision or
          presentation of paid copyrighted works, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ListArea>
    <p>
      Specifically, selling pirated copies of manga, movies, anime, etc., or publishing them on the internet can be a
      criminal offense even without a complaint from the rights owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, derivative works such as fanzine (dōjinshi) sold at Comiket and other events remains a crime
      prosecutable upon a complaint from the victim.
